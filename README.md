# Terrace Survival

![](demo.gif)

Terrace Survival is a game I developed within my first month of working in Unity. Itâ€™s a game where the user is locked out on a terrace, and in order to survive, the user must scavenge and collect items to make themselves a meal until someone comes to rescue them.
